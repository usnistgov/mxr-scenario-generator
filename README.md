# Mobility Generation for 10 Scenarios

This repository contains the code necessary to generate mobility for the 10 scenarios discussed in our paper. The generated output is intended to be used as input with the [NIST Q-D Realization Software](https://github.com/wigig-tools/qd-realization) software to further generate the channel models required for ns-3 simulation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Generating Mobility

To generate the mobility data for the 10 scenarios, execute the following command:

```bash
python generateMobility.py
